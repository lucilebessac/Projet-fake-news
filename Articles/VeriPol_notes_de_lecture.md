## Indices utiles à notre projet

In general, the more details provided in the report, the more likely it is to be honest. - Page 2

## Outils utilisés

The methodology used is a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP)[26] algorithms, feature selection methods and Machine Learning (ML)[29] classification algorithms. - Page 4

Detection of false or deceptive texts [40, 19, 21, 59]. These works, that are mostly centered on the domain of spam detection and fake reviews
[43, 32, 22, 47], make use of traditional ML techniques such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression or decision trees [8, 25 - Page 4
